Software for the fuel cell UAV, powered by raspberryPi.

This repository contains the software necessary to replace the standard fuel cell controller provided by Horizon,
for the H-100 hydrogen fuel cell.  It also contains repositories provided by other developers (thanks to you)
to allow saving of flight data logs to the SD card, a USB memory stick/harddrive, and transmission over serial, TCP 
or UDP.

The software is still developmental, and as such doesn't currently have many walkthroughs, but do contact me or 
look at the wiki for further information.

Happy coding!

Simon
